# UX Ergonomics

Make the task easier to complete, and show what evidence would prove the change helped.

## Frame the job, then inspect the surface

Start with [task analysis](references/task-analysis/METHOD.md): actor, trigger, desired outcome, context, frequency, expertise, prerequisites, decisions, actions, feedback, interruptions, handoffs, failures, recovery, and completion evidence. Keep nominal flow and exceptions. Do not redesign while still determining the task.

Use [evidence synthesis](references/ux-evidence-synthesis/METHOD.md) and the [evidence ladder](references/evidence-and-validation.md) to separate direct product behavior, research, standards, inspection, and anecdotes. Record source population, method, setting, date, applicability, contradictions, and uncertainty. Source count is not strength; do not derive prevalence from complaints or social posts.

## Review through the relevant lenses

For discoverability, action, feedback, and learning use [cognitive walkthrough](references/cognitive-walkthrough/METHOD.md). State assumed knowledge and distinguish predicted breakdown from observed behavior. For accessibility use [layered evaluation](references/accessibility-evaluation/METHOD.md): automation, source semantics, keyboard/focus/reflow/motion/timing/error behavior, assistive technology, cognitive access, and affected-user tasks as warranted. A subset cannot establish full conformance.

For agents use [authority mapping](references/human-agent-authority-map/METHOD.md): information visibility, decision/execution owner, consequence, uncertainty, reversibility, preview/approval/intervention/undo/retry/escalation, completion evidence, and memory/deletion control. Scale friction to the actual risk and existing grant, not a blanket request for confirmation. Consider longitudinal, organizational, and adversarial effects using the retained deeper contexts.

## Recommend a falsifiable change

For each consequential finding separate observation, inference, recommendation, and requirement. Name the mechanism, affected task/state, consequence, evidence level, alternatives, uncertainty, and acceptance criterion. Use [acceptance criteria](references/ux-acceptance-criteria/METHOD.md); add a numeric threshold only with a baseline, risk, requirement, or decision-power reason. State the method and evidence that would fail the recommendation.

The credited [visual craft material](references/visual-craft.md) preserves distinct source roles and does not require an install. Use it only to serve the task and preserve the author's intentional choices; do not convert a design preference into a measured usability claim.

## Verify and learn

Apply [adversarial verification](references/ergonomics-verification/METHOD.md), returning pass/revise/blocked with material gaps. Use [study design](references/usability-study-design/METHOD.md) for the lightest valid empirical check: population/variation, tasks/states/environment, behavior measures, assistance/critical errors/abandonment, moderation/counterbalance/access, analysis, stop rule, and generalization bounds. Small formative studies can expose breakdowns; they do not estimate prevalence. Questionnaires supplement behavior.

Return a task-and-evidence map, prioritized findings, authority decisions, concrete changes, acceptance criteria, validation status, and unresolved evidence. An uncalibrated weighted rubric or a structural test is not observed benefit.
